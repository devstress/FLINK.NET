# Metrics and Monitoring in Flink.NET (Future)

This page will detail how to monitor Flink.NET applications and the metrics exposed by the JobManager and TaskManagers.

**Note: Comprehensive metrics and monitoring infrastructure for Flink.NET is planned for future development.**

## Planned Features

*   **Integration with OpenTelemetry**: Flink.NET aims to leverage OpenTelemetry for collecting and exporting metrics, traces, and logs. The `.NET Aspire` solution (`FlinkDotNetAspire`) already includes basic OpenTelemetry setup.
*   **JobManager Metrics**: Metrics related to job status, checkpointing, resource management, and API interactions.
*   **TaskManager Metrics**: Metrics related to task execution, data processing rates (records/bytes in/out), buffer usage, garbage collection, and state backend operations.
    *   Currently, some basic metrics like `flinkdotnet.taskmanager.records_sent` and `flinkdotnet.taskmanager.records_received` are implemented (see `CreditAwareTaskOutput.cs` and `DataExchangeServiceImpl.cs`).
    *   The `HeartbeatRequest` in the gRPC API also includes `TaskMetricData` for records in/out.
*   **Operator-Level Metrics**: Granular metrics for individual operator instances.
*   **System Metrics**: JVM/.NET runtime metrics (CPU, memory, GC) for JobManager and TaskManager processes.
*   **Dashboard Integration**: Guidance on integrating Flink.NET metrics with monitoring systems like Prometheus and Grafana, or using the .NET Aspire Dashboard for local development.

## Current Status

*   Basic record count metrics (`records_sent`, `records_received`) are implemented in the TaskManager.
*   The `.NET Aspire` environment provides an initial setup for OpenTelemetry and allows viewing of these basic metrics and service health.
*   A comprehensive, Flink-like metrics system with reporters and detailed metric groups is not yet fully implemented.

## Future Work

This page will be updated with:
*   A list of all available metrics from JobManager, TaskManager, and operators.
*   Configuration options for metrics reporters (e.g., Prometheus, JMX, custom reporters).
*   Examples of setting up monitoring dashboards.
*   Guidance on interpreting key metrics for performance tuning and troubleshooting.
