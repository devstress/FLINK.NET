# Core Concepts: State Management Overview in Flink.NET

Stateful stream processing is a key strength of Apache Flink, and Flink.NET aims to provide robust state management capabilities for .NET developers. State is crucial for applications that need to remember information over time, such as aggregations, windowing operations, or finite state machines.

## What is State in Flink.NET?

In Flink.NET, state refers to data that operators maintain and update as they process streaming events. This state is versioned and checkpointed, allowing for fault tolerance and consistent recovery.

## Types of State in Flink.NET

Flink.NET will support different types of state, mirroring Apache Flink's offerings, to cater to various use cases:

*   **Keyed State:** This is the most common type of state and is scoped to a specific key within a data stream. When a stream is partitioned using `KeyBy()`, each key has its own independent state. Flink.NET will provide the following types of keyed state:
    *   `IValueState<T>`: Stores a single value of type `T`. You can `Update(T value)` it and retrieve the `Value()`.
    *   `IListState<T>`: Stores a list of elements of type `T`. You can `Add(T value)`, `AddAll(List<T> values)`, retrieve the `Get()` as `IEnumerable<T>`, and `Update(List<T> values)` to replace the entire list.
    *   `IMapState<UK, UV>`: Stores a map of key-value pairs (`UK`, `UV`). You can `Put(UK key, UV value)`, `Get(UK key)`, retrieve all `Entries()`, `Keys()`, `Values()`, and `Remove(UK key)`.
    *   *(Others like `IReducingState` and `IAggregatingState` may be considered based on Apache Flink's model).*

*   **Operator State:** (To be detailed further in advanced sections if implemented) This state is scoped to an instance of an operator, rather than a key. It's useful for sources and sinks that need to remember offsets or manage connections.

## State Descriptors

To create or access state, you use a `StateDescriptor`. This object defines:

*   **State Name:** A unique name for the state within an operator.
*   **Serializer/Type Information:** How the state's data should be serialized and deserialized. Flink.NET will aim to infer this from the generic types or allow custom serializers.

## State Backends (Planned)

A State Backend determines how and where state is stored. Apache Flink offers different state backends (e.g., memory, filesystem, RocksDB). Flink.NET plans to support configurable state backends:

*   **MemoryStateBackend:** Stores state in memory on the TaskManagers. Suitable for development and small state sizes.
*   **FsStateBackend (or similar for .NET):** Stores state in a file system (e.g., HDFS, local FS).
*   **RocksDBStateBackend (or similar for .NET):** Stores state in an embedded RocksDB instance. This is often the preferred choice for large state and offers incremental checkpointing.

The choice of state backend impacts performance and scalability.

## Working with State

Operators that use state typically implement a "rich" interface (e.g., `IRichMapOperator`) which provides an `IRuntimeContext`. This context gives access to methods for creating and retrieving state.

See [[Working with State|Developing-State]] for detailed examples.

## Relationship to Apache Flink State Management

Flink.NET's state management is designed to be closely aligned with Apache Flink's concepts. The types of state, the use of state descriptors, and the role of state backends are all derived from Flink's battle-tested model. This ensures that .NET developers can leverage Flink's powerful fault tolerance and state consistency features.
