# Windowing API in Flink.NET (Future)

Windowing is a core concept in stream processing that allows you to perform computations on bounded slices of a potentially infinite stream. Flink.NET plans to provide a rich Windowing API, inspired by Apache Flink, to support various window types and triggering mechanisms.

**This documentation page is a placeholder for the detailed Flink.NET Windowing API, which is currently under development or planned for a future release.**

## Core Concepts (Planned)

The Flink.NET Windowing API is expected to include concepts such as:

*   **Window Assigners**: Define how elements are assigned to windows (e.g., tumbling windows, sliding windows, session windows, global windows).
    *   Classes like `TumblingEventTimeWindows`, `GlobalWindows` can be found in `FlinkDotNet.Core.Api.Windowing`.
*   **Triggers**: Determine when a window is ready to be processed (e.g., based on event time, processing time, count, or custom logic).
    *   Interfaces like `Trigger<TElement, TWindow>` and initial implementations like `EventTimeTrigger` exist in `FlinkDotNet.Core.Api.Windowing`.
*   **Evictors (Optional)**: Allow removing elements from a window before or after the trigger fires but before the window function is applied.
*   **Window Functions**: Define the computation to be performed on the elements of a window (e.g., `IReduceOperator`, `IAggregateOperator`, or a more general `IProcessWindowFunction`).
*   **Event Time and Processing Time**: Support for windowing based on when events occurred (event time) or when they are processed by Flink (processing time).
*   **Watermarks**: Mechanism in event time processing to track the progress of time and signal when windows can be closed.

## Current Status

*   The foundational classes for windowing (e.g., `Window.cs`, `WindowAssigner.cs`, `Trigger.cs`, `TimeWindow.cs`, various `Transformation` types for windowing in `FlinkDotNet.Core.Api.Streaming.Transformations.cs`) are present in the codebase.
*   The `IWindowOperator` interface in `FlinkDotNet.Core.Abstractions.Operators` is a placeholder.
*   The `KeyedStream.Window()` method and `WindowedStream` class provide the entry points for applying window assigners.
*   The full runtime logic for window lifecycle management, state handling for windows, timer services, and advanced trigger/evictor functionality is still a significant area of ongoing development.

## What to Expect

Once fully implemented, you will be able to perform operations like:

```csharp
// Conceptual Example:
DataStream<MyEvent> keyedStream = ... ; // Assume this is a KeyedDataStream

DataStream<ResultType> windowedResult = keyedStream
    .Window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.Of(Time.Seconds(10))) // Assign to 10-second tumbling windows
    .Trigger(new MyCustomTrigger()) // Optional: custom trigger
    .Aggregate(new MyAggregationFunction(), /* optional: new MyProcessWindowFunction() */); // Apply a window function
```

Please refer to the Apache Flink documentation on [Windowing](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/) for general concepts that inspire Flink.NET's design.

**This page will be updated with detailed Flink.NET specific examples and API documentation as the Windowing API matures.**
