# Core Concepts: JobManager in Flink.NET

The JobManager is a central component in both Apache Flink and Flink.NET. It plays a crucial role in coordinating the execution of distributed streaming applications.

## Role in Flink.NET

In Flink.NET, the JobManager is responsible for:

*   **Job Submission:** Receiving Flink.NET applications (jobs) submitted by the client. This involves taking the application's logical plan (JobGraph) and preparing it for execution.
*   **Resource Management:** Requesting and allocating resources (TaskSlots on TaskManagers) needed for the job. While Flink.NET might leverage external resource managers like Kubernetes, the JobManager orchestrates this process from Flink's perspective.
*   **Job Execution Coordination:**
    *   Deploying tasks (the parallel instances of operators) to TaskManagers.
    *   Monitoring the status of tasks and TaskManagers.
    *   Triggering and coordinating checkpoints to ensure fault tolerance.
    *   Coordinating recovery in case of failures.
*   **Metadata Management:** Maintaining metadata about running jobs, checkpoints, and overall cluster status.
*   **Web UI:** Providing a web interface (inherited from Apache Flink) for monitoring jobs, inspecting logs, and understanding the cluster's state.

## Flink.NET Implementation Specifics

*   **Interaction with .NET Code:** The Flink.NET JobManager (or components it interacts with) must be able to understand and manage .NET-based operator logic. This might involve communication protocols or mechanisms to load and execute .NET assemblies within the Flink execution environment (potentially on TaskManagers under JobManager's coordination).
*   **High Availability (HA):**
    *   **Planned:** Similar to Apache Flink, High Availability for the JobManager in Flink.NET is a planned feature. This will prevent it from being a single point of failure.
    *   **Mechanism:** HA typically involves running multiple JobManager instances, with one active leader and others on standby. A distributed coordination service like ZooKeeper is often used to manage leader election and recovery information. Flink.NET will aim to provide a robust HA solution.

## Relationship to Apache Flink JobManager

The Flink.NET JobManager fulfills the same conceptual role as the JobManager in Apache Flink. Users familiar with Flink's architecture will find the responsibilities and behaviors largely consistent. Flink.NET aims to provide this critical component, enabling .NET developers to benefit from Flink's distributed processing capabilities.
