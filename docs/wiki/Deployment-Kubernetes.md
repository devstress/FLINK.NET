# Kubernetes Deployment for Flink.NET (Future)

This page will provide comprehensive guidance on deploying Flink.NET applications to Kubernetes.

**Note: Detailed Kubernetes deployment strategies and official Helm charts or Kustomize configurations for Flink.NET are planned for future development.**

## Core Concepts for Kubernetes Deployment (Planned)

Deploying Flink.NET on Kubernetes will involve considerations similar to deploying Apache Flink:

*   **Containerization**: Packaging JobManager and TaskManager processes into Docker images.
*   **JobManager Deployment**:
    *   Typically deployed as a Kubernetes `Deployment` or `StatefulSet`.
    *   High Availability (HA) for JobManagers will require leader election and durable storage for metadata (e.g., using Kubernetes HA patterns or external stores like ZooKeeper/etcd, though Flink.NET might opt for alternatives).
*   **TaskManager Deployment**:
    *   Typically deployed as a Kubernetes `Deployment`.
    *   Can be scaled based on workload.
*   **Job Submission**: How to submit `JobGraph`s to the JobManager running in Kubernetes (e.g., via a Kubernetes `Service` exposing the JobManager's REST or gRPC API).
*   **Configuration**: Managing Flink.NET configurations via ConfigMaps and Secrets.
*   **Resource Management**: Defining CPU and memory requests/limits for JobManager and TaskManager pods.
*   **Networking**: Ensuring proper network communication between JobManager, TaskManagers, and external services.
*   **State Management**: Configuring state backends, especially for durable storage like PersistentVolumes or object stores (S3, Azure Blob Storage) when using stateful applications.
*   **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrating with Kubernetes logging solutions (e.g., EFK/ELK stack) and monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

## Current Status

*   The Flink.NET JobManager and TaskManager are designed as separate services that can be containerized.
*   The `.NET Aspire` setup (`FlinkDotNetAspire`) demonstrates local orchestration of these services, which shares some principles with containerized deployments.
*   Official deployment scripts, Helm charts, or Kubernetes Operators for Flink.NET are not yet available.

## Future Work

This page will be updated with:
*   Example Dockerfiles for JobManager and TaskManager.
*   Sample Kubernetes manifest files (`Deployment`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, etc.).
*   Guidance on High Availability (HA) setup for JobManager.
*   Best practices for resource allocation and configuration.
*   Instructions for job submission in a Kubernetes environment.
