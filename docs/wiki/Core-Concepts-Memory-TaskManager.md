# Core Concepts: TaskManager Memory in Flink.NET

TaskManagers are the workhorses of a Flink cluster, executing the data processing tasks. Their memory configuration is critical for performance and stability. Flink.NET applications, with their C# operator logic, will run on these TaskManagers, making this configuration particularly relevant.

FlinkDotnet has a detailed TaskManager memory model, which Flink.NET will adopt.

## Overview of TaskManager Memory Components

The total memory allocated to a TaskManager process is divided into several components. Understanding these is key to proper configuration:

1.  **Total Process Memory (`taskmanager.memory.process.size`):**
    *   The entire memory available to the TaskManager JVM process (and the .NET runtime hosted within or alongside it for Flink.NET).

2.  **Total Flink Memory (`taskmanager.memory.flink.size`):**
    *   Memory dedicated to Flink itself, excluding JVM overhead. This is further subdivided:
    *   **Framework Heap Memory (`taskmanager.memory.framework.heap.size`):**
        *   Used by Flink's internal framework code (e.g., for communication, metadata). Not for operator code.
    *   **Task Heap Memory (`taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size`):**
        *   **Crucial for Flink.NET:** This is the heap memory available to your C# operators (map, filter, stateful logic, etc.). The .NET Garbage Collector will manage this for C# objects.
        *   If too small, you might see `OutOfMemoryException` from your .NET code or excessive GC pressure.
    *   **Managed Memory (`taskmanager.memory.managed.size` or `fraction`):**
        *   Native (off-heap) memory managed by Flink.
        *   Used for sorting, hash tables (joins, aggregations), and as the primary store for RocksDB state backend.
        *   Can significantly improve performance by reducing GC overhead and allowing larger state sizes.
        *   Flink.NET stateful operations will leverage this when using appropriate state backends.
    *   **Network Memory (`taskmanager.memory.network.min/max` or `fraction`):**
        *   Memory allocated for network buffers (shuffling data between tasks). Essential for throughput.
        *   See [[Network Memory Tuning|Core-Concepts-Memory-Network]].

3.  **JVM Metaspace and Overhead (and .NET Equivalents):**
    *   **JVM Metaspace (`taskmanager.memory.jvm-metaspace.size`):** For class metadata.
    *   **JVM Overhead (`taskmanager.memory.jvm-overhead.min/max` or `fraction`):** For thread stacks, GC internal structures, other JVM needs.
    *   Flink.NET will also have overhead related to the .NET runtime (JIT code cache, GC structures, etc.). The configuration needs to account for this, though it might be implicitly part of the JVM overhead if .NET runs within the same process, or managed separately if Flink.NET runs .NET in a distinct manner.

## Flink.NET Specific Considerations

*   **Task Heap for C# Code:** The `taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size` is paramount for Flink.NET user code. You need to allocate enough here to accommodate the objects your C# operators create and manage on the heap.
*   **.NET GC Impact:** The behavior of the .NET Garbage Collector on the Task Heap will influence performance. Tuning GC settings (if exposed by Flink.NET or configurable at the .NET runtime level) might be necessary for demanding applications.
*   **Managed Memory for State:** When using stateful C# operators with a state backend like RocksDB (planned), understanding how much `managed.memory` is allocated is vital, as RocksDB will use this off-heap memory.
*   **Serialization:** The memory footprint of your C# objects on the heap, and their serialized form (for network transfer or state storage), will impact overall memory usage. Efficient [[Serialization|Core-Concepts-Serialization]] is key.

## Configuring TaskManager Memory

Configuration is typically done via `flink-conf.yaml` or equivalent Flink.NET mechanisms (e.g., environment variables for containerized deployments).

**Key Configuration Options (from FlinkDotnet):**

*   `taskmanager.memory.process.size`: (e.g., `4g`) - Total memory for the TM process.
*   *Alternatively, configure components individually. Flink recommends configuring `taskmanager.memory.flink.size` and letting Flink derive other components, or configuring specific components like `task.heap`, `managed.memory`, and `network`.*
*   `taskmanager.memory.flink.size`: (e.g., `3g`)
*   `taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size`: (e.g., `1g`) - **Important for Flink.NET C# code.**
*   `taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction` (e.g., `0.4`) or `taskmanager.memory.managed.size` (e.g., `1200m`).
*   `taskmanager.memory.network.fraction` (e.g., `0.1`) or `taskmanager.memory.network.min` and `taskmanager.memory.network.max`.
*   `taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots`: The number of parallel tasks a TaskManager can run. Memory is shared among slots.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```yaml
# In flink-conf.yaml
taskmanager.memory.process.size: 4096m

# Or, more fine-grained (Flink often recommends this approach):
# taskmanager.memory.flink.size: 3072m # Flink memory (excluding JVM overhead)
# taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size: 1024m # For your C# operators
# taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction: 0.4 # 40% of Flink memory for managed off-heap
# taskmanager.memory.network.fraction: 0.1 # 10% of Flink memory for network buffers
```

## General Recommendations for Flink.NET

*   **Start with Flink's recommendations:** Use the Flink documentation as a base.
*   **Monitor Task Heap:** Pay close attention to the Task Heap usage via Flink's metrics or .NET profiling tools if possible. This is where your C# code lives.
*   **Allocate Sufficient Managed Memory:** If using RocksDB or performing operations that spill to managed memory (large sorts, joins), ensure `managed.memory` is adequately sized.
*   **Consider Number of Task Slots:** More slots mean memory is divided further. Ensure each slot has enough memory for the tasks it runs.
*   **Iterate and Tune:** Memory tuning is often an iterative process. Monitor, adjust, and observe the impact. See [[Memory Tuning|Core-Concepts-Memory-Tuning]].

## Relationship to FlinkDotnet

Flink.NET TaskManagers will operate under the same memory model as FlinkDotnet. The key difference is that the "Task Heap" will be managed by the .NET runtime for C# operator code, rather than solely by the JVM for Java/Scala code.
