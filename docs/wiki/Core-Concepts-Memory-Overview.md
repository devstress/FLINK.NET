# Core Concepts: Flink.NET Memory Overview

## Introduction

Memory management is crucial for achieving optimal performance, stability, and resource efficiency in Flink.NET applications. This document provides an overview of how Flink.NET processes manage memory, focusing on deployments in Kubernetes and local execution environments. Understanding these concepts will help you configure Flink.NET effectively.

## Flink.NET Process Memory Model (General)

A Flink.NET process, whether a JobManager or a TaskManager, runs as a .NET Core application. Its memory footprint is composed of several areas:

*   **Managed Heap:** This is the primary memory area managed by the .NET Garbage Collector (GC). It stores objects created by the Flink.NET framework, user-defined functions (UDFs), and application code. The size and behavior of the managed heap, along with GC activity (e.g., frequency, pauses), significantly impact performance.
    *   *.NET Garbage Collector (GC):* Flink.NET utilizes the standard .NET GC. Understanding its behavior (e.g., generational collection, Large Object Heap for objects >85KB) is beneficial. Server GC is typically recommended for production workloads on multi-core machines due to its higher throughput, though Workstation GC might be used in resource-constrained local development.
*   **Stack Memory:** Each thread within a Flink.NET process has its own stack for storing local variables and method call frames. This is generally smaller and managed automatically.
*   **(Potential) Off-Heap Memory:** While .NET primarily relies on the managed heap, Flink.NET could theoretically utilize off-heap memory for specific high-performance components like custom network buffer pools or specialized state backends. However, direct off-heap management is less common in idiomatic .NET applications compared to JVM-based systems. If Flink.NET components use off-heap memory, their management will be detailed in relevant sections.

## Interaction with Kubernetes

When deploying Flink.NET on Kubernetes, memory management involves two levels:

1.  **Kubernetes Pod Resources:**
    *   You define memory requests (`resources.requests.memory`) and limits (`resources.limits.memory`) for each Flink.NET JobManager and TaskManager pod in your Kubernetes deployment specifications.
    *   `requests.memory` guarantees that amount of memory for the pod.
    *   `limits.memory` enforces a hard cap. If a pod exceeds this limit, Kubernetes may terminate it (OOMKilled).
2.  **Flink.NET Internal Memory Configurations (Planned):**
    *   Flink.NET aims to provide its own set of internal memory configurations (e.g., for total process memory, .NET heap size, network buffer sizes).
    *   These configurations will guide how Flink.NET partitions and utilizes the memory allocated to its pod by Kubernetes. For example, you might allocate a 4Gi pod in Kubernetes, and then Flink.NET configurations would specify how much of that 4Gi is targeted for the .NET heap, network buffers, etc.
    *   This allows for finer-grained control over Flink.NET's internal memory usage within the overall pod allocation.

## Configuration Approach

Flink.NET memory settings are planned to be configurable via:

*   **Configuration Files:** E.g., `appsettings.json` (standard .NET Core approach).
*   **Environment Variables:** Allowing overrides in containerized environments.
*   **Command-Line Arguments:** For ad-hoc adjustments.

Key configuration categories will likely include:
*   Total memory available to the Flink.NET process.
*   .NET runtime heap size.
*   Memory allocated for network communication (network buffers).
*   Memory for state backends (if they have tunable memory components).

Detailed parameters will be covered in the specific JobManager and TaskManager memory sections.

## Key Memory Components (High-Level)

The memory requested by a Flink.NET JobManager or TaskManager is utilized by several internal components:

*   **.NET Runtime:** Overhead for the .NET runtime itself.
*   **Flink.NET Framework Code:** Memory used by the core framework logic, job graph representation, coordination services, etc.
*   **Application Code:** Memory consumed by user-defined functions, data objects, and application-specific logic.
*   **Network Buffers:** Essential for data transfer between TaskManagers (shuffling data) and between JobManagers and TaskManagers.
*   **State Backends:** If using memory-intensive state backends, they will contribute significantly to memory usage.
