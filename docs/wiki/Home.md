# Welcome to Flink.NET

## Overview of Flink.NET

Flink.NET is a .NET library that allows developers to write and execute Apache Flink applications using C#. It aims to provide a familiar and intuitive experience for .NET developers while leveraging the power and scalability of Apache Flink.

*(See main [Readme.md](../../Readme.md) for more details)*

## Key Features & Goals

*   **Native .NET Development:** Write Flink applications entirely in C# using familiar .NET patterns and libraries.
*   **Apache Flink Compatibility:** Leverage the core strengths of Apache Flink, including its robust stream processing engine, fault tolerance, and state management capabilities.
*   **Extensibility:** Designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of custom operators, connectors, and state backends.
*   **Simplified Deployment:** (Future Goal) Streamlined deployment options, potentially integrating with .NET Aspire and Kubernetes.

## Relationship to Apache Flink

Flink.NET is built upon the foundations of Apache Flink. It acts as a .NET layer that interacts with Flink's core components.

*   **Philosophy of Alignment:** Flink.NET strives to align with Apache Flink's core concepts and architecture. Many Flink.NET components have direct counterparts in Apache Flink, and the documentation will often refer to the official Apache Flink documentation for deeper understanding.
*   **Key Differences:**
    *   **.NET Ecosystem:** Flink.NET is tailored for the .NET ecosystem, utilizing C# as the primary language and integrating with .NET libraries and tools.
    *   **Implementation Choices:** Specific implementation choices may differ from Apache Flink's Java implementation to better suit the .NET environment.

## Use Cases

Flink.NET can be used for a variety of stream processing applications, including:

*   Real-time data analytics
*   Event-driven microservices
*   Complex event processing
*   Data ingestion and transformation pipelines
*   Anomaly detection

*(This section will be expanded with more specific examples in the future.)*
