# Welcome to Flink.NET

## Overview of Flink.NET

Flink.NET is a .NET library that allows developers to write and execute Flink.Net applications using C#. It aims to provide a familiar and intuitive experience for .NET developers while leveraging the power and scalability of Flink.Net.

*(See main [Readme.md](../../Readme.md) for more details)*

## Key Features & Goals

*   **Native .NET Development:** Write Flink applications entirely in C# using familiar .NET patterns and libraries.
*   **Flink.Net Compatibility:** Leverage the core strengths of Flink.Net, including its robust stream processing engine, fault tolerance, and state management capabilities.
*   **Extensibility:** Designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of custom operators, connectors, and state backends.
*   **Simplified Deployment:** (Future Goal) Streamlined deployment options, potentially integrating with .NET Aspire and Kubernetes.

*(See main [Readme.md](../../Readme.md) for more details)*

## Relationship to Flink.Net

Flink.NET is built upon the foundations of Flink.Net. It acts as a .NET layer that interacts with Flink's core components.

*   **Philosophy of Alignment:** Flink.NET strives to align with Flink.Net's core concepts and architecture. Many Flink.NET components have direct counterparts in Flink.Net, and the documentation will often refer to stream processing standards for deeper understanding.
*   **Key Differences:**
    *   **.NET Ecosystem:** Flink.NET is tailored for the .NET ecosystem, utilizing C# as the primary language and integrating with .NET libraries and tools.
    *   **Implementation Choices:** Specific implementation choices may differ from Java-based implementations to better suit the .NET environment.

*   [Fundamental Architecture Concepts](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/docs/concepts/flink_architecture/) - Reference patterns

## Use Cases

Flink.NET can be used for a variety of stream processing applications, including:

*   Real-time data analytics
*   Event-driven microservices
*   Complex event processing
*   Data ingestion and transformation pipelines
*   Anomaly detection

## Flink.Net Best Practices

For production-ready applications, follow our comprehensive best practices guides:

* **[[Flink.Net Best Practices: Stream Processing Patterns|Flink.Net-Best-Practices-Stream-Processing-Patterns]]** - Complete guide to Flink.Net standard pipeline patterns
* **[[Flink.Net Back Pressure|FLINK_NET_BACK_PRESSURE]]** - Credit-based flow control and back pressure handling
* **[[RocksDB State Backend|Core-Concepts-RocksDB-State-Backend]]** - Enterprise-grade state management

### Recommended Pipeline Pattern

Follow the Flink.Net standard pattern for optimal performance:

```
Source -> Map/Filter -> KeyBy -> Process/Window -> AsyncFunction -> Sink
```

This pattern provides:
- Superior performance and scalability
- Built-in fault tolerance and exactly-once semantics  
- Rich monitoring and observability
- Industry-standard patterns and maintainability
