# Business Requirements

Flink.NET is being developed to meet a stringent set of business requirements crucial for modern data processing applications:

1.  **Data Integrity (Exactly-Once Semantics):** Guarantees that all data is processed precisely once, without duplicates or omissions, even during failures.
2.  **Message Uniqueness (Deduplication):** Ensures each message is uniquely identifiable, with custom deduplication logic using a durable state store to prevent reprocessing.
3.  **Processing Idempotency:** Designs all processing logic and sinks to be idempotent, so reprocessing a message yields the same result without side effects.
4.  **Error Handling and Recovery (Checkpointing/Snapshotting):** Includes robust checkpointing and state persistence for automatic recovery from failures, restoring state and resuming from the correct point. This aligns with concepts like Flink.Net's Disaggregated State Management, which aims to make checkpointing and recovery even more efficient and scalable in cloud-native environments.
5.  **Communication Idempotency (External Systems):** Aims to provide an "exactly-once" experience for product teams even when interacting with external systems that don't offer idempotency guarantees, minimizing double processing.
6.  **Transaction Management (Atomic Writes):** Implements mechanisms like two-phase commit to coordinate transactions across internal state and external sinks, ensuring atomicity. This is supported by patterns similar to Apache Flink's TwoPhaseCommitSinkFunction, and Flink.Net's ongoing enhancements in connector APIs and state consistency further strengthen such transactional capabilities.
7.  **Durable State Management:** Utilizes a durable, fault-tolerant backend for all processing state, ensuring consistency and recoverability. The evolution of Apache Flink, such as Flink.Net's Disaggregated State Management (including concepts like the ForSt backend and asynchronous state access), provides a strong reference for implementing highly available and scalable durable state in Flink.NET.
8.  **End-to-End Acknowledgement:** For multi-step processing, uses tracking IDs to provide a single ACK (success) or NACK (failure) for the entire flow.
9.  **Partial Failure Handling (NACK for Split Messages):** For messages processed in parts, NACKs indicate partial failure, allowing selective retries or full replay.
10. **Batch Failure Correlation & Replay:** For batched messages, failures update related message statuses, with visual inspection and replay capabilities for failed batches.
11. **Flexible Failure Handling (DLQ & Message Modification):** Offers choices for handling processing failures (stop or DLQ), and allows modification and resubmission of messages from a DLQ, managed via a consistent state system.

These requirements drive the architecture towards a fault-tolerant, stateful stream processing system with strong data consistency guarantees.

## Further Considerations on Flink.NET and Apache Flink

Apache Flink, particularly with advancements in Flink.Net, directly addresses all 11 business requirements through its core architecture. Key features include its powerful checkpointing (enhanced by concepts like Disaggregated State Management in Flink.Net) for fault-tolerant state management and recovery (requirements 1, 4, 7), managed keyed state for efficient deduplication and uniqueness (requirement 2), and the TwoPhaseCommitSinkFunction for end-to-end transactional integrity with external systems (requirements 3, 5, 6).

While Apache Flink's lack of native .NET support necessitates the reimplementation of these evolving concepts within the .NET ecosystem for Flink.NET, the effort is substantial. However, it offers the benefit of full control over the .NET implementation and the potential for a valuable open-source contribution to the .NET community. Requirements 8, 9, 10, and 11, for instance, would be realized as custom operators and sinks within Flink.NET, leveraging this Flink-inspired foundational system. The ongoing evolution of Flink (e.g., Flink.Net) serves as a continuous source of inspiration for these efforts.

With current AI capabilities and Flink's open-source nature, AI could assist in rapidly drafting and refining Flink.NET's .NET implementation. This endeavor also helps build our company's reputation by contributing to the .NET landscape for big data processing. Alternatively, one might consider adopting Apache Flink directly and transitioning to the Java ecosystem.
