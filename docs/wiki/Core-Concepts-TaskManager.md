# Core Concepts: TaskManager in Flink.NET

The TaskManager is a worker process in the Flink architecture, responsible for executing the tasks of a dataflow. Multiple TaskManagers can run in a Flink cluster, and they execute tasks in parallel.

## Role in Flink.NET

In Flink.NET, the TaskManager's primary responsibilities include:

*   **Task Execution:** Running the actual data processing logic (operators like map, filter, reduce, etc.) defined in a Flink.NET application. Each TaskManager has one or more **TaskSlots**, which are the units of resource allocation.
*   **Data Buffering and Exchange:** Managing network buffers for shuffling data between different tasks, both locally and across different TaskManagers.
*   **State Management:** Storing and managing task state locally, interacting with configured state backends for durability.
*   **Heartbeating and Reporting:** Sending heartbeats to the JobManager to indicate liveness and reporting task statuses.
*   **Checkpoint Participation:** Participating in the checkpointing process by taking snapshots of its task states and reporting them to the JobManager.

## Flink.NET Implementation Specifics

*   **.NET Task Execution:** Flink.NET TaskManagers are responsible for executing tasks written in C#. This involves:
    *   Receiving serialized .NET code (or instructions to load it).
    *   Setting up the necessary .NET runtime environment.
    *   Executing the .NET operator logic.
*   **Pod Structure (if applicable, e.g., in Kubernetes):** When deployed in containerized environments like Kubernetes, each TaskManager typically runs in its own pod. This allows for isolated resource management and scaling.
*   **Communication with JobManager:** TaskManagers communicate with the JobManager to receive tasks, report status, and send checkpoint acknowledgments. This communication is typically handled via Flink's internal RPC mechanisms.

## Relationship to FlinkDotnet TaskManager

The Flink.NET TaskManager performs the same fundamental functions as its FlinkDotnet counterpart. It is the component where the user-defined business logic (operators) gets executed. The core principles of task slots, data exchange, and state handling are consistent.

Flink.NET ensures that .NET developers can write their logic in C#, and the TaskManager environment is capable of executing this .NET code efficiently as part of a distributed Flink job.
