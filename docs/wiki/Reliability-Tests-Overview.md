# Reliability Tests - Fault Tolerance and Recovery Testing

This document explains FLINK.NET reliability testing infrastructure, what we do, and why we follow these practices to achieve world-class fault tolerance standards.

## Overview

Our reliability tests validate FLINK.NET's ability to maintain data processing integrity under adverse conditions. They simulate real-world failure scenarios while ensuring exactly-once processing guarantees and automatic recovery capabilities that meet Apache Flink's highest reliability standards.

  "timestamp": "2024-12-20T10:16:16.346Z",
  "job_id": "reliability-test-1",
  "task_id": "task-996",
  "kafka_partition": 996,
  "kafka_offset": 99996,
  "processing_stage": "source->map->sink",

## Fault Injection Configuration

The reliability tests support configurable fault injection:

```bash
# Environment variables for fault injection control
