# Core Concepts: Exactly-Once Semantics in Flink.NET

Exactly-once semantics are a cornerstone of robust stream processing, ensuring that each piece of data is processed precisely one time, even in the event of system failures. Flink.NET, by leveraging FlinkDotnet's architecture, aims to provide these strong consistency guarantees for .NET applications.

## What Does Exactly-Once Mean?

In the context of stream processing, exactly-once semantics guarantee that:

*   **No Data Loss:** Every record from the input sources will be processed.
*   **No Data Duplication:** No record will be processed more than once, even if failures and retries occur.

This means the final state of your application and its outputs will be the same as if the processing happened perfectly once, without any interruptions.

## How Flink.NET Achieves Exactly-Once

Achieving exactly-once semantics is a collaborative effort between several components and mechanisms within the Flink architecture, which Flink.NET adopts:

1.  **Replayable Data Sources:**
    *   The data sources (e.g., Kafka, Pravega) must be able to replay streams of data from a specific point (an offset or sequence number).
    *   When a job recovers from a failure, Flink rewinds the sources to the point of the last successful checkpoint.

2.  **Checkpointing:**
    *   As described in [[Core Concepts: Checkpointing & Fault Tolerance|Core-Concepts-Checkpointing-Overview]], Flink periodically takes consistent snapshots of the application's state.
    *   These checkpoints include the current state of all operators and the current reading offsets for input sources.
    *   This is the most critical part: ensuring that operator state and source offsets are captured atomically.

3.  **State Backends:**
    *   Durable state backends (like [[FsStateBackend or RocksDBStateBackend|Core-Concepts-State-Management-Overview#state-backends-planned]]) ensure that checkpointed state is stored reliably and is available for recovery.

4.  **Transactional Sinks (Two-Phase Commit) or Idempotent Writes:**
    *   This is crucial for ensuring that outputs to external systems are also exactly-once.
    *   **Transactional Sinks:** For sinks that support transactions (e.g., Kafka producers, specific database connectors), Flink uses a two-phase commit protocol.
        *   **Pre-commit Phase:** When a checkpoint is triggered, operators write their outgoing data to the sink but don't officially "commit" it yet. They notify the JobManager once this pre-commit is done.
        *   **Commit Phase:** Once the JobManager receives acknowledgments from all operators that their part of the checkpoint (including pre-commits to sinks) is successful, it notifies the operators that the checkpoint is complete. The operators then instruct the sinks to commit the transaction.
        *   If a failure occurs before the commit phase, the transaction is aborted, and no data is actually written from that partial checkpoint. Upon recovery, processing resumes from the last successful checkpoint, and the data will be written and committed with a future checkpoint.
    *   **Idempotent Writes:** If a sink does not support transactions, the write operations must be idempotent. This means that writing the same data multiple times has the same effect as writing it once. This can be achieved by using unique keys for writes or by designing downstream systems to handle duplicates gracefully.

## Conditions for Exactly-Once in Flink.NET Applications

To achieve end-to-end exactly-once semantics in your Flink.NET application, you need to ensure:

1.  **Checkpointing is enabled.**
2.  **You are using replayable data sources.** Most modern message queues (like Kafka) provide this.
3.  **You are using appropriate sinks:**
    *   Either sinks that support Flink's two-phase commit protocol (transactional sinks).
    *   Or, your write operations to sinks are idempotent.
4.  **Your user-defined operator logic is deterministic:** Given the same input and state, your operator should always produce the same output. Non-deterministic behavior can lead to unpredictable results upon recovery, even if the underlying Flink mechanisms are working correctly.

## Flink.NET's Commitment

Flink.NET is designed to provide the necessary building blocks and abstractions to enable .NET developers to build applications with exactly-once guarantees by faithfully implementing FlinkDotnet's core fault tolerance mechanisms.
