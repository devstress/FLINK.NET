# Stress Tests - High-Performance Load Testing

This document explains FLINK.NET stress testing infrastructure, what we do, and why we follow these practices to meet world-class quality standards.

## Overview

Our stress tests validate FLINK.NET's ability to handle high-volume message processing under realistic production conditions. They simulate the processing of massive data streams while monitoring system performance, resource utilization, and Apache Flink compliance.

## What We Do

### 1. High-Volume Message Processing
- **Message Count**: Process up to 10 million messages per test run
- **Throughput Target**: Achieve 1+ million messages/second processing capacity
- **Load Distribution**: Utilize all 20 TaskManagers for parallel processing
- **Message Flow**: Source → Map → Dual Sink (Kafka + Redis)

### 2. Apache Flink 2.0 Compliance Testing
- **FlinkKafkaConsumerGroup**: Custom consumer group management with checkpoint-based offset control
- **Exactly-Once Processing**: Disable Kafka auto-commit, manage offsets through checkpointing
- **Cooperative Sticky Partition Assignment**: Minimize rebalancing disruption during scaling
- **State Management**: Implement `ICheckpointedFunction` for proper state preservation

### 3. Infrastructure Validation
- **Redis Connectivity**: Enhanced connection timeout and retry logic (60s timeout, 5 retries)
- **Kafka Connectivity**: Bootstrap server discovery and topic validation
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker-based Redis and Kafka with dynamic port allocation
- **Environment Discovery**: Automated Aspire port discovery for container services

### 4. TaskManager Load Distribution
- **All 20 TaskManagers Active**: Each TaskManager handles partition assignment for optimal load sharing
- **Dynamic Partitioning**: 20 Kafka partitions in stress test mode (1 per TaskManager)
- **Load Balancing Metrics**: Real-time monitoring of TaskManager workload distribution
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, and throughput across all TaskManagers

### 5. Observability and Monitoring
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Console metrics, tracing, and detailed monitoring enabled
- **Performance Analytics**: Throughput, latency, memory usage, and success rate tracking
- **Real-time Logging**: Live progress monitoring with detailed status updates
- **BDD-Style Reporting**: Given/When/Then scenario validation with pass/fail status

## Why We Do This

### 1. Apache Flink World Standards
Our stress tests ensure compliance with Apache Flink 2.0 industry standards:

**Consumer Group Management**
- Apache Flink uses its own consumer group strategy rather than standard Kafka consumers
- We implement `FlinkKafkaConsumerGroup` with the same patterns as Apache Flink
- This provides exactly-once processing guarantees and proper fault tolerance

**Checkpoint-Based Offset Management**
- Follows Apache Flink's approach of disabling auto-commit and managing offsets through checkpointing
- Ensures data consistency and exactly-once semantics under failure conditions
- Provides proper state recovery and resumption capabilities

**Load Distribution Philosophy**
- Apache Flink's approach distributes work across all available TaskManagers
- Our stress tests validate this by using all 20 TaskManagers actively
- This ensures optimal resource utilization and scalability validation

### 2. Production Readiness Validation

**High-Volume Processing**
- Real-world data streams often involve millions of messages per second
- Our stress tests validate the system can handle production-scale workloads
- Tests identify bottlenecks before they impact production systems

**Infrastructure Resilience**
- Production environments require robust connection handling and error recovery
- Enhanced Redis/Kafka connection logic with proper timeouts and retries
- Container orchestration testing ensures deployment reliability

**Resource Management**
- Production systems must efficiently utilize available hardware resources
- All 20 TaskManagers working in parallel validates horizontal scaling capabilities
- Memory and CPU monitoring ensures resource efficiency

### 3. Quality Assurance Standards

**Comprehensive Validation**
- BDD-style testing provides clear documentation of expected behavior
- End-to-end pipeline testing from source through dual sinks
- Performance benchmarks ensure consistent quality standards

**Industry Best Practices**
- Follows stream processing industry standards for testing methodologies
- Implements Apache Flink's recommended patterns for consumer groups and state management
- Validates exactly-once processing semantics critical for financial and mission-critical applications

**Continuous Integration**
- Automated stress testing in CI/CD pipelines ensures quality gates
- Performance regression detection through consistent benchmarking
- Infrastructure validation prevents deployment of broken configurations

## Test Components

### Core Components
1. **FlinkJobSimulator**: Orchestrates message generation and processing
2. **HighVolumeSourceFunction**: Generates sequential messages with Redis-based sequencing
3. **FlinkKafkaConsumerGroup**: Apache Flink-compliant consumer group implementation
4. **TaskManagerKafkaConsumer**: Distributes load across all 20 TaskManagers
5. **Dual Sink Architecture**: Simultaneous output to Kafka and Redis for validation

### Infrastructure Components
1. **Redis**: Message sequencing, counters, and state storage
2. **Kafka**: Message streaming with 20 partitions for load distribution
3. **Docker Orchestration**: Container management via Aspire
4. **Port Discovery**: Dynamic infrastructure endpoint resolution

### Monitoring Components
1. **Real-time Metrics**: Throughput, latency, and resource utilization
2. **Load Balancing Analytics**: TaskManager distribution monitoring
3. **Health Checks**: Infrastructure connectivity validation
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Success rate and timing validation

## Success Criteria

### Performance Standards
- **Throughput**: Achieve 1+ million messages/second
- **Latency**: Complete processing within configured time limits
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal CPU and memory utilization across TaskManagers
- **Success Rate**: 100% message processing without data loss

### Quality Standards
- **Apache Flink Compliance**: All patterns match Apache Flink 2.0 standards
- **Exactly-Once Semantics**: No message duplication or loss
- **State Consistency**: Proper checkpoint and recovery behavior
- **Infrastructure Reliability**: Robust connection handling and error recovery

### Scalability Standards
- **Horizontal Scaling**: All 20 TaskManagers actively participating
- **Load Distribution**: Even workload distribution across TaskManagers
- **Dynamic Partitioning**: Proper partition assignment and rebalancing
- **Resource Scaling**: Efficient utilization of available hardware resources

## Running Stress Tests

Execute the stress test script:
```powershell
./scripts/run-local-stress-tests.ps1 -MessageCount 1000000 -MaxTimeMs 10000
```

This validates FLINK.NET's production readiness against world-class Apache Flink standards while ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
