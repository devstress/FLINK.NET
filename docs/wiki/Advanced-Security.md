## Overview

This page will cover security aspects of Flink.NET applications and deployments.

**Note: Comprehensive security features for Flink.NET are planned for future development.**

## Planned Security Considerations

*   **Securing Cluster Communication**:
    *   Using TLS/SSL for gRPC communication between JobManager and TaskManagers.
    *   Securing REST API endpoints (e.g., with HTTPS, authentication/authorization).
*   **Authentication**:
    *   Mechanisms for clients to authenticate with the JobManager.
    *   Internal authentication between Flink.NET components.
*   **Authorization**:
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) for managing jobs and accessing APIs.
*   **Connector Security**:
    *   Securely configuring credentials for source and sink connectors (e.g., for Kafka, databases, cloud services).
    *   Using Kubernetes Secrets or similar mechanisms for managing sensitive configurations.
*   **State Backend Security**:
    *   Encryption at rest for state stored in durable backends.
*   **Data Serialization**:
    *   Considerations for secure deserialization, especially if using general-purpose serializers with untrusted data (though Flink.NET's default `MemoryPack` with POCOs is generally safer than reflection-based serializers for arbitrary types).
*   **Container Security**:
    *   Best practices for building secure Docker images for Flink.NET components.
    *   Running containers with minimal privileges.

## Current Status

*   Basic communication between components is typically over HTTP/gRPC without transport layer security explicitly configured by default within Flink.NET itself (this might be handled by the environment, e.g., service mesh in Kubernetes).
*   There are no built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms yet.
*   Security for connectors and state backends depends on the specific external systems and how they are configured.

## Future Work

This page will be updated with:
*   Configuration guides for enabling TLS/SSL.
*   Details on supported authentication/authorization mechanisms.
*   Best practices for securing Flink.NET deployments in various environments (e.g., Kubernetes).
*   Guidance on secure connector configuration.
