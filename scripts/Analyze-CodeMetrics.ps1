<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Generates a code metrics report using Metrics.exe, parses it, and checks against predefined thresholds.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script invokes the Visual Studio Metrics.exe tool to analyze a given solution or specific assemblies.
    It then parses the XML output and checks Cyclomatic Complexity, Maintainability Index, and Class Coupling
    against configurable thresholds.

    Prerequisites:
    - Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise (for Metrics.exe).
    - The path to Metrics.exe might need adjustment based on VS version and installation.
.PARAMETER MetricsExePath
    The full path to Metrics.exe.
.PARAMETER SolutionPath
    The full path to the .sln file to analyze. Can be relative to the script's location.
.PARAMETER OutputXmlPath
    The path where the raw XML metrics report will be saved. Can be relative to the script's location.
.PARAMETER FailBuildOnError
    If $true, the script will exit with a non-zero code if any 'Error' thresholds are breached.
    If $false, it will only print warnings and errors but always exit with 0.
