# Flink.NET

**Flink.NET** is an ambitious open-source project aiming to create a powerful, scalable, and fault-tolerant stream processing engine, built entirely within the .NET ecosystem. Inspired by [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/), it seeks to provide .NET developers with a native solution for sophisticated real-time data processing.

The core objective is to implement fundamental stream processing concepts like stateful processing, exactly-once semantics, high throughput, low latency, and rich APIs, all within the .NET framework.
