# Flink.NET

**Flink.NET** is an ambitious open-source project aiming to create a powerful, scalable, and fault-tolerant stream processing engine, built entirely within the .NET ecosystem. Inspired by the robust architecture and comprehensive feature set of [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/), Flink.NET seeks to provide .NET developers with a native solution for building sophisticated real-time data processing applications.

The core objective of Flink.NET is to implement the fundamental concepts that make Apache Flink a leader in stream processing, including:

*   **Stateful Stream Processing:** Enabling complex computations over unbounded data streams with rich state management capabilities.
*   **Exactly-Once Semantics:** Ensuring data integrity and consistency even in the face of failures.
*   **High Throughput and Low Latency:** Designing for performance to handle demanding real-time workloads.
*   **Rich Connectors and APIs:** Providing a flexible framework for integrating with various data sources and sinks, and offering intuitive APIs for developers.

This project endeavors to bring the power of distributed stream processing to the .NET world, allowing developers to leverage their existing C# skills and .NET libraries to build cutting-edge data-intensive applications. While drawing heavily from Apache Flink''s proven design patterns, Flink.NET will also embrace .NET idioms and best practices to create a familiar and productive environment for its users.

## Business Requirements

Flink.NET is being developed to meet a stringent set of business requirements crucial for modern data processing applications:

1.  **Data Integrity (Exactly-Once Semantics):** Guarantees that all data is processed precisely once, without duplicates or omissions, even during failures.
2.  **Message Uniqueness (Deduplication):** Ensures each message is uniquely identifiable, with custom deduplication logic using a durable state store to prevent reprocessing.
3.  **Processing Idempotency:** Designs all processing logic and sinks to be idempotent, so reprocessing a message yields the same result without side effects.
4.  **Error Handling and Recovery (Checkpointing/Snapshotting):** Includes robust checkpointing and state persistence for automatic recovery from failures, restoring state and resuming from the correct point.
5.  **Communication Idempotency (External Systems):** Aims to provide an "exactly-once" experience for product teams even when interacting with external systems that don''t offer idempotency guarantees, minimizing double processing.
6.  **Transaction Management (Atomic Writes):** Implements mechanisms like two-phase commit to coordinate transactions across internal state and external sinks, ensuring atomicity.
7.  **Durable State Management:** Utilizes a durable, fault-tolerant backend for all processing state, ensuring consistency and recoverability.
8.  **End-to-End Acknowledgement:** For multi-step processing, uses tracking IDs to provide a single ACK (success) or NACK (failure) for the entire flow.
9.  **Partial Failure Handling (NACK for Split Messages):** For messages processed in parts, NACKs indicate partial failure, allowing selective retries or full replay.
10. **Batch Failure Correlation & Replay:** For batched messages, failures update related message statuses, with visual inspection and replay capabilities for failed batches.
11. **Flexible Failure Handling (DLQ & Message Modification):** Offers choices for handling processing failures (stop or DLQ), and allows modification and resubmission of messages from a DLQ, managed via a consistent state system.

These requirements drive the architecture towards a fault-tolerant, stateful stream processing system with strong data consistency guarantees.

## Why Flink.NET?

While Apache Flink stands as a powerful and mature stream processing solution, Flink.NET aims to address several key motivations and create unique value, particularly for organizations and developers invested in the .NET ecosystem:

*   **Native .NET Capabilities:** Provides a stream processing framework that integrates seamlessly with existing .NET applications, libraries, and skillsets. This allows .NET teams to build sophisticated stream processing solutions without needing to bridge to or manage a separate Java-based infrastructure.
*   **Leveraging the .NET Ecosystem:** Enables the use of familiar .NET tools, languages (C# primarily), and development patterns, fostering productivity and reducing the learning curve for .NET developers.
*   **Open Source Contribution & Community Building:** By being an open-source project, Flink.NET aims to contribute to the .NET community, fostering collaboration and innovation in the big data and stream processing space within the .NET world. It offers an opportunity to build and shape a significant piece of .NET infrastructure.
*   **Addressing Specific Organizational Needs:** For teams primarily working with .NET, having a native Flink-like engine can simplify deployment, monitoring, and operational overhead compared to managing a polyglot environment.
*   **Modern Development Approaches:** The project was initiated with the idea of potentially leveraging modern development techniques, including AI-assisted code generation and insights, to accelerate its development and explore new ways of building complex software.
*   **Enhancing Technical Reputation:** Contributing a high-quality, Flink-inspired stream processing engine to the open-source .NET landscape can significantly enhance the technical reputation and leadership of contributing organizations and individuals.
*   **Full Control and Customization:** Building Flink.NET from the ground up in .NET offers complete control over the architecture and implementation, allowing for fine-tuned customizations and optimizations tailored to specific .NET environments or performance characteristics.

Flink.NET is not just about replicating Apache Flink in a new language; it''s about creating a first-class, .NET-native stream processing engine that empowers .NET developers and enriches the .NET open-source ecosystem.

## System Design Overview

Flink.NET is architected as a distributed stream processing system designed for scalability, fault tolerance, and exactly-once processing semantics. It draws inspiration from Apache Flink''s robust architecture, adapting its core components to the .NET ecosystem and a Kubernetes-native deployment model.

### Key Architectural Components

The system comprises several key interacting components:

*   **[JobManager](./docs/wiki/Core-Concepts-JobManager.md) (Singleton/Leader Election):** This central component orchestrates job execution, manages checkpoints for fault tolerance, detects failures, and coordinates recovery processes. In a high-availability setup, leader election ensures there's always one active JobManager.
*   **[TaskManagers](./docs/wiki/Core-Concepts-TaskManager.md) (Worker Nodes):** These are distributed .NET applications, typically running as Kubernetes Pods. TaskManagers are responsible for:
    *   Consuming input data streams.
    *   Executing the actual data processing logic (operators defined by the user).
    *   Managing local state for stateful operations (see [State Management Overview](./docs/wiki/Core-Concepts-State-Management-Overview.md)).
    *   Interacting with external data sinks.
*   **Connectors (Sources & Sinks):** These are specialized components or libraries responsible for interfacing with external data systems. Sources read data from systems like Apache Kafka, Azure Event Hubs, etc., while Sinks write processed data to databases, APIs, or other messaging systems.
*   **Durable State Backend:** A persistent, scalable, and highly available storage solution (e.g., a distributed database like Cosmos DB, SQL Server, or a key-value store for metadata; or object stores like MinIO/S3 for snapshots) is used to store all processing state and checkpoint metadata. This is crucial for achieving fault tolerance and exactly-once semantics, as detailed in the [Checkpointing Overview](./docs/wiki/Core-Concepts-Checkpointing-Overview.md).
*   **Job Submission & Management API:** A RESTful (and potentially gRPC) API exposed by the JobManager allows users and external systems to submit new processing jobs, monitor their status, manage their lifecycle (e.g., stop, cancel, scale), and inspect checkpoint information.

### Architectural Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the high-level interaction between these components within a Kubernetes environment:

        User[User/Product Team] --> API(Job Management API)

    end
```

This architecture is designed to enable parallel processing of data streams across multiple TaskManagers, coordinated by the JobManager, with robust state management and fault tolerance mechanisms ensuring data integrity and continuous operation.
